# Python-demo
These are a collection of Jupyter Notebook slides demonstrating various python concepts. You need Jupyter Notebooks to view these files and here is how you can get started.

- Install Jupyter Notebooks `pip install jupyter`
- For an immersive/ interactive experience may I suggest installing RISE as well `pip install RISE`
- Finally, enable the RISE extension in your Jupyter Notebook `jupyter-nbextension install rise --py --sys-prefix`
- When you open your Jupyter Notebook, save your code and click on `Enter\Exit RISE Slideshow` button on the right of command palette button in the tool menu.
